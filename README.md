Password Strength Checker

Small solo project to explore password strength estimation, reusable scoring logic, and a simple CLI and web view. This repo intentionally grows in small, realistic steps with multiple commits.

Planned pieces:
- Core scoring function with length, variety, and common word checks
- CLI tool for quick checks
- Minimal web page for interactive feedback
- Lightweight tests, no runtime required

No build is required; the code is plain JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

Quick start

- CLI: `node scripts/cli.mjs 'MyPass123!'`
- Web: open `web/index.html` in a browser
